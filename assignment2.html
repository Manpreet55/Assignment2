She is the author of three novels: Attic, Truck, and Geek Love, which was a finalist for both the National Book Award and the Bram Stoker Prize. She died in 2016.
                                        Dunn began her first novel Attic while studying at Reed, and she left without graduating. At a Christmas break trip to Ashbury Heights in 1967, she met a man she would spend the next 10 years with. They traveled to Mexico, Boston, Newfoundland, and Seville, where she finished Attic, then to Karpathos, where she finished her second novel Truck (1971) and became pregnant. She gave birth to her son in Dublin, Ireland, and after seven years living in various places, they returned to Portland to stay "because there was a good alternative public school", the Metropolitan Learning Center (Portland, Oregon). She settled in the Nob Hill neighborhood, where she lived until her death.
